## 🏗️ **Architecture Goal**
<!-- Describe the architectural improvement objective -->

## 📊 **Current Architecture Issues**

**Organization Problems:**
- [ ] File structure: X files in flat structure
- [ ] Naming inconsistencies: List issues
- [ ] Dependency chaos: Circular dependencies, unclear imports

**Maintainability Issues:**
- [ ] Code scattered across files
- [ ] No clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Difficult to locate functionality

## 🎯 **Target Architecture**

**New Structure:**
```
proposed-structure/
├── folder1/
│   ├── file1.js
│   └── file2.js
├── folder2/
│   └── file3.js
└── folder3/
    └── file4.js
```

**Benefits:**
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Logical grouping by functionality
- [ ] Easier maintenance and debugging
- [ ] Better scalability

## 📋 **Implementation Plan**

### Phase 1: Structure Creation
- [ ] Create new folder structure
- [ ] Define clear naming conventions
- [ ] Document architectural decisions

### Phase 2: File Migration
- [ ] Move files to appropriate folders
- [ ] Update import paths
- [ ] Maintain backwards compatibility during transition

### Phase 3: Optimization
- [ ] Optimize module dependencies
- [ ] Remove circular dependencies
- [ ] Update build/deployment scripts

## 📁 **Migration Map**

| Current File | New Location | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `old-file1.js` | `folder1/new-name.js` | Better grouping |
| `old-file2.js` | `folder2/feature.js` | Feature-based org |

## 🔄 **Backwards Compatibility**

**During Migration:**
- [ ] Keep old file structure temporarily
- [ ] Add deprecation warnings
- [ ] Provide migration guide

**After Migration:**
- [ ] Remove old files
- [ ] Update all references
- [ ] Clean up legacy imports

## 📖 **Documentation Updates**

- [ ] Update README.md with new structure
- [ ] Create ARCHITECTURE.md documentation
- [ ] Update development guidelines
- [ ] Add folder/file naming conventions

## 🧪 **Validation Checklist**

**Structure Validation:**
- [ ] All files in logical locations
- [ ] Consistent naming throughout
- [ ] No orphaned files
- [ ] Clear dependency tree

**Functionality Validation:**
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly
- [ ] No broken references
- [ ] Build process works
- [ ] Deployment succeeds

## 📈 **Improvement Metrics**

**Before:**
- Total files: X
- Folder depth: Y levels
- Average files per folder: Z
- Circular dependencies: N

**After:**
- Total files: X (organized)
- Folder depth: Y levels (optimized)
- Average files per folder: Z (balanced)
- Circular dependencies: 0
