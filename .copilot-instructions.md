# GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are an expert AI programming assistant working on the **GlocalSpirit Landing Page** project.

## Project Context

This is a modern landing page project with the following key characteristics:

### 🏗️ **Architecture**
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with GSAP animations
- **Backend**: PHP with Teams webhook integration and email functionality  
- **Hosting**: Strato hosting environment (PHP 7.4+)
- **Payment**: Stripe integration for donation subscriptions (€22/€44/€55 packages)

### 🎨 **Design & Animation**
- **Design System**: Glassmorphism cards with gradient backgrounds
- **Animation Library**: GSAP with ScrollTrigger and ScrollSmoother plugins
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with tablet and desktop breakpoints
- **Navigation**: Smooth scrolling anchor links with active state management

### 📝 **Forms & Backend**
- **Form Types**: Beta tester registration and donation subscription forms
- **Validation**: Both client-side (real-time) and server-side validation
- **Backend Integration**: PHP backend with Teams webhook notifications
- **Security**: CORS protection, input sanitization, rate limiting
- **Feedback**: Loading states, success/error handling with user feedback

### 🔧 **Technical Considerations**
- **Error Handling**: JavaScript includes element existence checks to prevent console errors
- **Configuration**: Centralized config through `config.js` and `config.php`
- **Performance**: Optimized GSAP animations with proper cleanup
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support (primarily DE/EN)
